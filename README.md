# Project Introduction
The continuous improvement of our digital world presents a challenging hurdle for our society. We find loads of articles and videos that require users to invest much of their time only to access minute information. This problem happened to numerous people around us, from professional workers to students, and even people who rarely access digital videos and articles. They have much more valuable time to spend on other activities. With SumRizz, we are trying to address Indonesia's structural digital literacy problems and create a better tool to help those improvements.

This project is designed with students in mind, aiming to help them efficiently extract key information from lengthy articles. What sets us apart is that our application is built on a dedicated platform, providing a unique user experience compared to web-based extensions. We're strategically engaging with campus communities for user testing and word-of-mouth promotion while utilizing Google Ads for broader exposure. Our commitment to continuous feature development beyond the beta release reflects our dedication to meeting user needs. We're also exploring cost-effective subscription options and ad-based access to cater to diverse user preferences. With cross-platform accessibility and a focus on innovation, we're poised to stand out in the competitive landscape of summarization applications.
